# Credit Card Fraud detection Using Azure Machine learning SKD for Python
With the improvement of technology and its effect on daily life, the amount of fraud and scams increased as well. Many seniors cannot keep themselves up with technology and as the business of scams evolves every day to look more “real” many of these seniors become major targets for financial fraud.
In this project, we tried to take a step to detect the best Ml algorithms to detect the scam patterns, develop our model as a component and use local deployment to visualize the data by a confusion matrix.
As the project is currently finished we still working on the system to improve its functionality :)
